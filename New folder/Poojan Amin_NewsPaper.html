                    India's gold imports in FY25 shot up by a stunning 38% to a decade-high of 855
                    tonnes, despite record-high prices. According to data from Ahmedabad Air  Cargo
                    Complex, the import volume that was highest in 10 years. "Lower import >duty has 
                    helped to improve the demand.<br><br> Moreover, there is strong demand from the jewellery
                    industry in Gujarat and Mumbai," said an official at the complex. The average gold
                    price in FY25 was ₹60,400/10 gm—highest in a financial year ever—up from ₹51,800/10
                    gm in FY24.<br><br> However, the import duty cut from 12.5% to 10% helped offset the cost.
                    "Imports remained strong due to weddings and festivals. Also, investors bought gold
                    as a safe haven amid geopolitical uncertainties and global market volatility," said

                    Trump's move to impose harsh tariffs on Chinese goods triggered a full-blown trade
                    war and global recession fears. After Friday's market selloff following Trump's statement,
                    the Indian markets opened sharply lower on Monday with the Sensex and Nifty falling
                    nearly 4%.<Br><br> The BSE Sensex crashed 2,227 points to 72,739 while the NSE Nifty fell 
                    691 points to 21,945. The rupee weakened to 83.50 against the US dollar as investors
                    moved to safe havens like gold and bonds. "Markets are reacting to global uncertainty.

                    The day's sell off left investors poorer by Rs 14.2 lakh crore with BSE's market capitalisation
                    now at Rs 389.3 lakh crore. This was the third biggest single day plunge in investors wealth

                    fund managers and strategists said world markets were in unknown territory, and hence risks
                    are high. However, they said given India's small share in global trade, the impact could be
                    limited.

                    turf, the game against Delhi Capitals was certainly an awakening for his supporters that there is more

                    always be 50-50.    Dhoni's greatness in all these years has been his immaculate sense of timing whether
